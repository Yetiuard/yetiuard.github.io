        body: "Even if buying was owning, piracy would still not be stealing. Pirating any media is not stealing, it's just copying and distributing. You're not taking money away from the multi-billion dollar companies, just not giving them the profit they were supposed to get. Some companies are truly evil, like nintendo taking down every fan-game for being even REMOTELY associated with their intellectual property. Or taking down ROMs which can't be officially bought, only second-hand from scalpers on e-bay and other sites. Genuinely, how many pieces of media were lost just because the greedy company that owned them just took them down to maximize profit? Would it not make more sense to OFFICIALLY release the roms or at least sell them? Anyways, all this \"license\" bullshit is just scummy. I don't care if it's a big ass movie from a big studio or an indie video game, I am STILL pirating that shit if I can't OWN the files I am paying for. And then people be like \"Oh but it's morally wrong to pirate indie title-\" bitch shut up, genuinely I am NOT paying just for big marketplace to tell me \"oh you paid for this but you dont own it you have a license for it\" SHUT. UP. GENUINELY. I BOUGHT IT. I AM USING IT HOW I WANT TO.",

I know I will never get past getting into the Mario 64 castle, and I will never get past the Super Mario Bros. Virtual Console title screen. It's like I do it for the data hoarder in me, even though it just wastes space and time. In conclusion, I pirate games, movies, and shows I will never touch.",
